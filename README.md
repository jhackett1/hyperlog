Hyperlog
========

Hyperlog is a 24/7 cloud audio and data logger for online radio stations.

Hyperlog keeps a rolling archive of your station's transmitted audio output to fulfil statutory requirements, and continuously deleting files older than a certain age.

Unlike traditional solutions, it does not need to be fed via a hardware audio input on the server, meaning that it is suitable for stations with minimal on-site infrastructure, or who use multiple studios in remote locations.

Log files can be managed via a browser interface or a simple JSON API.
